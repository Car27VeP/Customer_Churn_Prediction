# DMResources Limited - Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a customer churn prediction model for **DMResources Limited (DMR)**, a Mexican Fintech company specializing in personalized microcredits for SMEs. Due to a higher-than-expected default rate in their credit portfolio, DMR has requested Accenture to redesign their default risk (churn) model to comply with Mexican regulations and optimize profitability.


## Methodology
### 1. **Data Processing & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Data cleaning (handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies)
- Feature engineering and selection
- Exploratory analysis through visualizations and statistical tests

### 2. **Model Development**
- Train-test split with a fixed random seed for reproducibility
- Evaluation of different classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance
- Model comparison based on key evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC)

### 3. **Model Deployment & Reporting**
- Final model selection and saving
- Summary tables and reports for business stakeholders
- Presentation slides with insights and recommendations
